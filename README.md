Red-Black Tree Visualizer
A desktop application built in C++ with Windows Forms to visually demonstrate Red-Black Tree operations. The project is designed as an educational aid for understanding how self-balancing binary search trees maintain balance through insertions, deletions, rotations, and recoloring.

Features
Interactive Visualization: Real-time graphical representation of insert, delete, and search operations.

Step-by-Step Animations: Each transformation (rotation, recoloring, etc.) is animated to reflect internal tree rebalancing.

Color-Coded Nodes: Clear distinction between red and black nodes for better comprehension.

User Interface: Intuitive Windows Forms interface with controls for user input and tree interaction.

Technologies
Language: C++

GUI Framework: Windows Forms (WinForms)

Design: Object-oriented programming with modular architecture for separation of concerns (data structure logic, animation handling, GUI).
