# Red-Black Tree Visualizer

A desktop application built in C++ with Windows Forms to visually demonstrate Red-Black Tree operations. The project showcases how self-balancing binary search trees maintain balance through insertions, deletions, rotations, and recoloring.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time graphical representation of insert, delete, and search operations.
- **Step-by-Step Animations**: Each transformation (rotation, recoloring, etc.) is animated to reflect internal tree rebalancing.
- **Color-Coded Nodes**: Clear distinction between red
